Q: Why do I receive an error when installing the package anytime?
A: The installation of package anytime might require the manual installation of the BH-package

          install.packages("anytime")

   this can take a bit of time, as the package is rather large. You can check whether the BH-package is installed by executing 

          installed.packages("BH")

   in the console.
